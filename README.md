## 🌍 Why This Project Matters

In 2017, approximately **450 million people** were diagnosed with diabetes, contributing to an estimated **1.37 million deaths globally**. Diabetes is not only a chronic condition but also a gateway to severe complications such as:

- 💔 Heart disease & stroke  
- 👁️ Vision loss  
- 🧠 Kidney failure  
- 🦶 Amputation of limbs  
- 🧬 Tissue dysfunction and chronic organ damage  

Early detection and intervention are **critical** to reducing the burden of diabetes on individuals and healthcare systems. By leveraging machine learning techniques, this project aims to assist in **early diagnosis**, potentially saving lives and improving long-term health outcomes.
